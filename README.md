# NAME-TK-WD2020-PART3

<p>For this assessment I have used Underscores, a base theme as a starting point for the back-end development of Wordepress websites. I have connected to this parent theme a child theme, in which I have developed the necessary files for the test: index (front-page.php), style.css, functions.php, single.php and content.php</p>
<p>In the index there are 2 sections:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The last 20 entries for all categories</li>
    <li>The last 6 entries for the Popular category (excluding the posts that appear in the first loop)</li>
</ol>
    
<p>The complete articles are shown through the single and content templates.</p>

<p>The elements that appear in each article are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blog post</li>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Date</li>
    <li>Attached image</li>
    <li>Text excerpt and a link to that single page with the text “Read more” (Index)</li>
    <li>Full article (Single page)</li>
</ul>
